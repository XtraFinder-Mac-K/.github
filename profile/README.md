## Overview

<a href="#">XtraFinder for macOS</a> is a specialized Finder enhancement designed for users who want a reliable, Mac-native tool with clear controls and stable performance. It relies on system frameworks, familiar interface patterns and predictable behavior so users can integrate it into daily routines without friction. The layout emphasizes clarity, with tools grouped into logical sections that keep both power and simplicity within reach.

In everyday use, <a href="#">XtraFinder</a> keeps core actions close at hand while offering additional <a href="#">advanced controls</a> for users who want to fine-tune behavior. Menus, shortcuts and panels follow Apple's design language, helping you move quickly between tasks. Whether you are exploring features for the first time or returning to established workflows, the environment stays consistent and reliable.

Under the hood, <a href="#">XtraFinder</a> is engineered around <a href="#">macOS technologies</a> that handle performance-critical work. This approach allows it to remain responsive even while processing complex operations, managing multiple tasks or handling large datasets at once. Background operations are handled quietly, keeping the interface smooth so that navigation, configuration and monitoring always feel responsive.

For professionals, <a href="#">XtraFinder</a> supports more demanding scenarios with configurable options, presets and automation-friendly behavior. Settings can be adjusted to match preferred habits, whether that means changing operational parameters, tuning performance rules or adapting how the app interacts with external services. These options are organized using descriptive <a href="#">preference panels</a> rather than hidden configuration files.

Over time, <a href="#">XtraFinder</a> becomes a dependable part of the Mac environment. Its combination of refined interface decisions, efficient processing and thoughtful defaults makes it suitable for long-term use. Users can trust that the application will behave consistently, preserve work safely and adapt as macOS continues to evolve.

The <a href="#">tabbed browsing</a> brings browser-style tabs to Finder windows efficiently. Open multiple locations in single windows, reducing desktop clutter while maintaining access to various folders.

<a href="#">Dual panel mode</a> displays two folder views side by side conveniently. Copy and move files between locations efficiently with source and destination visible simultaneously.

<a href="#">Cut and paste</a> adds proper file cutting that Finder lacks natively. Move files with familiar cut-paste workflow instead of drag or copy-delete operations.

The <a href="#">copy path</a> functionality extracts full file paths easily and quickly. Get complete paths for Terminal use, scripts, or documentation with one click.

<a href="#">Show hidden files</a> toggle reveals invisible items with keyboard shortcut. Access hidden configuration files and system items without Terminal commands.

<a href="#">Folders on top</a> sorting displays directories before files in listings. Organize views logically with folders grouped separately from documents.
